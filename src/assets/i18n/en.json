By using our service, the user acknowledges the possibility that the system and telecommunication network they use to access our service can be compromised, which is out of our control. For instance, the software the user has downloaded or websites visited may contain viruses or malwares that threaten the security of the wallet information. Therefore, it is imperative that users ensure the security of their personal information and data. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence.
